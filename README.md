This repository contains the R script I used (with RMarkdown/bookdown/papaja, and the Bayesian regression package brms) for the writing of my article "To pool or not to pool: that is the question in microbial kinetics", published in the International Journal of Food Microbiology, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.109283. It also contains the data and the brms fits.
